# ðŸš¢connectHooks

## How to use:

### Use your hooks in your old class components like so:

```jsx
export default connectHooks([
  {
    hook: useFetch,
    hookArgs: ['https://swapi.co/api/people/1'],
    toProps: ([isLoading, data]) => ({ isLoading, data })
  }
])(
  class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
    // ...
    render() {
      this.props.isLoading ? 'loading' : this.props.data
    }
  }
)
```

### Convert hooks to higherOrders like so:

```jsx
const withWindowSize = connectHooks([
  {
    hook: useWindowSize,
    toProps: windowSize => ({ windowSize })
  }
])
```

```jsx
// You can also combine multiple hooks into one HoC:

const withWindowSizeAndScrollPosition = connectHooks([
  {
    hook: useWindowScrollPosition,
    toProps: scrollPosition => ({ scrollPosition })
  },
  {
    hook: useWindowSize,
    toProps: windowSize => ({ windowSize })
  }
])
```

## Purpose:

`connectHooks` allows you to refactor your existing HoCs into hooks without needing to also refactor all your class based components that use them.

Simply rewrite your existing HoC into a custom hook. That makes it easy to consume in your newer functional components. Then use `connectHooks` to recreate the former HoC.

Long term, `connectHooks` probably isn't that helpful. Hooks elimate the need for class components, and in your new, functional components you can consume hooks directly. Over time, you can gradually replace your old class components, eventually eliminating the need for `connectHooks`.

## Installation

Simply paste the content of `connectHooks.js` into your codebase, it's only 20 lines of code. :3
